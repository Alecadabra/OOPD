Files in project: Factorial.java, Factorial.class

Test Files: factorialPseudoCode.txt, Factorial_testResults.txt

Functionality: The user inputs a number, a for loop is used to multiply the
itself as many times as the input. If the input was less than zero an error
is output. Otherwise the final answer is shown. The default answer is set
to 1 to account for zero as an input.
