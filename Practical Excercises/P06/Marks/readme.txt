Purpose: Use file I/O to read from a file and output the results.

Files in project: Mark.java, Mark.class

Test Files: markPseudoCode.txt

Functionality: After getting a filename from the user, reads the file line by
line, putting one line into an array of strings and the next line being parsed
into an array of doubles. The user enters a value from the string array and 
the corresponding double is output if the input value is found. The whole
thing loops and handles exceptions with most user input and file reading.

No known bugs
