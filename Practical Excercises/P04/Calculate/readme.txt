Purpose: Calculate the area of a rectangle in either cm^2 or m^2 with input
validation

Files in project: Calculate.java, Calculate.class

Test Files: Calculate_testResults.txt

Functionality: Length and width are inputted in cm. A for loop converts them
to positive if they are below 0. Menu selection using char selects either
cm^2 or m^2 for the output. The area is calculated and a switch statement does
unit conversion based on the previous menu selection.
