What line did the compile error occur?
    In Scope 2

Provide a detailed explanation of why the compile error occured,
    The scope was trying to access a variable that didn't exist in their scope,
    (elseVar) so the variable had to be declared at the start of the program
    to fix the error.

In Scope 1 two variables are used in the output statement. Where are they
declared and why are they accessible within this scope?
    Because they are declared in the main scope, which Scope 1 is inside of

In Scope 3 there is a nested elseif, similar to scope 2. Why does this instance
not cause an issue?
    Because the variable it is accessing is declared in it's parent scope

In Scope 4 the class constant CONS is initially accessed. The value is then
overwritten, explain how this is possible.
    CONS is declared as a integer variable inside of the scope, and it is 
    this that is assigned a value from scanner, not the the CONS constant.

When two variables of the same name exist, declared in different scopes,
which variable is actually used?
    The variable declared in the respective scope is used. A variable declared
    in a scope stops existing once the scope ends.
