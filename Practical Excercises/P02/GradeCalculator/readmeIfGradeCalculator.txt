Purpose: To categorise a unit total into a grade.

Files in project: IfGradeCalculator.java, IfGradeCalculator.class

Test files: GradeElseIf_testResults.txt, pseudoIfGradeCalculator.txt

Functionality: The program gets the unit total, truncates it into an integer and rounds the integer by checking if it's first decimal point of the original unit total is greater than 5. It then uses multiple if and if else statements to assign a 'grade' string a category name based on the value of the rounded mark. Then it prints this grade string.

No known bugs
