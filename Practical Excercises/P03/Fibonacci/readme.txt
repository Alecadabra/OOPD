Purpose: To calculate the first 19 digits of the Fibonacci sequence and
display a given entry in the sequence. Also loop the entire program.

Files in project: Fibonacci.java, Fibonacci.class

Test Files: pseudoFibonacci.txt

Functionality: Inside of a do-while loop, a do-while loop gets a menu
selection of either 'Input number' or 'exit' and validates it, giving an error
message as well as the menu prompt if the input is invalid. If 'input number'
is selected, the same validation process is used to get an inputted number
between 0 and 20 exclusive. The first two digits of the fibonacci sequence
(0 a 1) are entered into a 19 length array of integers. A for loop generates
the rest of the sequence. The chosen entry in the sequence is then  output.
The original do-while loop checks if the original menu selection is not 2, and
if true, loops the entire program.

No known bugs
