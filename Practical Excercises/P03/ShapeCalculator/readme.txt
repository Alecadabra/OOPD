Purpose: To calculate the area of a chosen shape, split it to it's square 
metre, square centimetre and square millimetre components. Also verify if 
inputted dimensions are valid and also looping the whole program

Files in project: ShapeCalculator.class, ShapeCalculator.java

Test Files: shapeCalculatorPseudoCode.txt, ShapeCalculator_testResults.txt

Functionality: The program asks for an input to calculate the area of either a
triangle, rectangle or circle or to exit the program. This input is checked for
validity and looped if it is not valid. Then dimensions are inputted for
the chosen shape (or the program exits depending on input). The program checks
the validity of the input and loops with an error message if they are not
valid. The program calculates the area of the chosen shape and splits it to 
it's square metre, square centimetre and square millimetre components and 
outputs this to the user, and loops the entire thing.

No known bugs
