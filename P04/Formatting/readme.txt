Purpose: Do various useless things with user input and random number
generation submodules

Files in project: WhatDoIDo.java, WhatDoIDo.class

Test Files: Questions.txt

Functionality: A menu selection switch statement is based on the return of a
method which  outputs the method's import and exports a user input integer.
If this is equal to 1, the user either inputs '1' using the same method from
before and gets an output of a number between 0 and 10 using a method, or they
input another number and the algorithm ends. In the '2' case, another method's 
return is outputted, this method finds a number between 0 and 1, multiplies
it by 42 and then adds 42. The '3' case is the same but a different method is
used that adds 1 instead of 42. The end.

There are also a bunch of useless parts of the code that have been commented
out.
