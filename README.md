# Object-Oriented Program Design

Part of my Computer Science degree at Curtin University in 2019. My final mark was 93%.

Contains my first ever code, beware.
There's no proper commit history because it wasn't developed using GitHub.

**Syllabus**

> Introduction to Unix. This unit introduces students to Object Oriented Algorithm Design and how to implement software designs in the Java programming language. Topics covered include: Compiling and executing a Java program, Primitive data types, Numeric expressions, how to design and implement sub modules, the principles behind algorithm control structures and their implementation in Java, object-oriented programming, message passing, inheritance and abstract classes. Implementation of object oriented programming in Java.

## [Assignment](Assignment)

A demonstration of implementing basic Object Orientation with abstract class inheritance, polymorphism and aggregation. Represents a ship management system for a wider program. Ships (Either Submarines or Fighter Jets) are stored and called upon for various functionalities. Data is read and saved to file. I made a very fancy text-based UI for it with my spare time.

## [Practical Excercises](Practical%20Excercises)

Weekly asessed assignments to demonstrate that week's course content. I don't provide the worksheets that these are based on for copyright reasons so they don't make a lot of sense without context.
