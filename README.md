From the unit handbook:

> Introduction to Unix. This unit introduces students to Object Oriented Algorithm Design and how to implement software designs in the Java programming language. Topics covered include: Compiling and executing a Java program, Primitive data types, Numeric expressions, how to design and implement sub modules, the principles behind algorithm control structures and their implementation in Java, object-oriented programming, message passing, inheritance and abstract classes. Implementation of object oriented programming in Java.

Contains my first ever code, beware.
There's no proper commit history because it wasn't developed using GitHub.

## Assignment

A demonstration of implementing basic Object Orientation with abstract class inheritance, polymorphism and aggregation. Represents a ship management system for a wider program. Ships (Either Submarines or Fighter Jets) are stored and called upon for various functionalities. Data is read and saved to file. I made a very fancy text-based UI for it with my spare time.

## Practical Excercises

Weekly asessed assignments to demonstrate that week's course content. I don't provide the worksheets that these are based on for copyright reasons so they don't make a lot of sense without context.
